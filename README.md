# Desktop Assistent: Alexa
This non-AI desktop assistant, named Alexa, is built using Python and leverages the SAPI5 text-to-speech engine for vocal responses. Various Python modules are utilized to perform a wide range of tasks, making Alexa a versatile and useful tool for day-to-day activities.  

Presented this project at **Hack the Mountains 2.0** hackathon and placed in the top 55 teams amongst 300+ teams.

## Features
1. Graphical User Interface (GUI):  
   - A user-friendly interface with 'Run' and 'Exit' buttons.  
   - Clicking 'Run' initiates Alexa, while 'Exit' shuts down the application.  

2. Voice Activation and Command Execution:
   - Alexa starts in a sleep mode for minimal disruption.
   - Activate Alexa by saying "ALEXA WAKE UP".
   - Wait for "Alexa is listening..." to be printed on the terminal before issuing any commands.

3. Speech Recognition:
   - Alexa uses Googleâ€™s API to convert spoken commands into text.
   - The recognized text is converted to lowercase to ensure consistent command matching.

4. Command Handling:
   - Alexa listens for specific commands and executes predefined tasks if present in the IF-ELSE ladder.
   - If an unknown command is issued, Alexa responds with "Sorry, I don't know that".

5. Sleep and Shutdown Commands:
   - Say "sleep" to put Alexa back into sleep mode.
   - Say "stop" to shut down Alexa.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo into your local machine and open it using VS code or any other editor of your choice.
2. Open the terminal and create a virtual environment using the command "python -m venv yourenvname".
3. Activate the virtual env created using the command "yourenvname\Scripts\activate".
```
IMP: Python version to be used is 3.9
```
4. Once activated, install all the packages using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".
5. Once all packages are installed create a .env file with the following vars
```
VSCODE_LOCATION= (Location of Code.exe in your PC)
WEATHER_API_KEY= (Get it from https://openweathermap.org/api)
NEWS_API_KEY= (Get it from https://newsapi.org/)
EMAIL= (Email ID you want to send email from)
SECRET_KEY= (App Password of the email. Steps to get this given below)
RECEIVER_WHATSAPP_NUMBER= (Number whom you want to send the whatsapp message. Format: +91 Number)
WHATSAPP_MESSAGE= (Whatsapp message you want to send)
TIME_IN_24_HRS= (Time in hrs at which you to send the message. Eg: "21")
TIME_IN_MINS= (Time in mins at which you to send the message. Eg: "30". So message will be sent at 09:30pm)
```
6. Now you are ready to run the application. Type 'py alexa.py' in the terminal and hit enter.
7. A GUI created using pyqt5 will open. Clicking on the run button starts alexa.
8. Just say 'Alexa wake up' and your desktop assistant is ready to perform the tasks you ask to do it.
